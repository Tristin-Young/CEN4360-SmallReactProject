# Overview
This project aims to show off the understanding of common React Hooks. The project is a simple react application that takes in data from a user through a form and regurgitates that information back to the user. I have also added the functionality to recall the last entry, which was not a requirement but seemed nifty. The form is structured with controlled components as I found that more readable and understandable.
